#The Pybank analysis Goal:


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire peri



# 1. Total number of months included in the dataset

total_months = df.shape[0]

print(f"Total Months: {total_months}")

 

# 2. Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

net_total = df['Profit/Losses'].sum()

print(f"Net Total Profit/Losses: ${net_total}")

 

# 3. Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

df['Change'] = df['Profit/Losses'].diff()

 

# Average of those changes

average_change = df['Change'].mean()

print(f"Average Change in Profit/Losses: ${average_change:.2f}")

 

# 4. Greatest increase in profits

greatest_increase = df.loc[df['Change'].idxmax()]

increase_date = greatest_increase['Date']

increase_amount = greatest_increase['Change']

print(f"Greatest Increase in Profits: {increase_date} (${increase_amount})")

 

# 5. Greatest decrease in profits

greatest_decrease = df.loc[df['Change'].idxmin()]

decrease_date = greatest_decrease['Date']
